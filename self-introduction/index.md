Hello. My name is Artem.
 I am 30 years old and a beginner frontend programmer.
 I'm studying software engineering at university and additionally learning frontend.
I am`set a goal of 3000 hours of learning frontend programming.
 Now I have 600 hours. 
I chose this number not by chance. 
I had 3000 hours in DotA, and I decided that if I could waste 3000 hours, then I can spend it on programming.
I have not worked with any major projects, so I am on these courses
As for motivation, I have no motivation. 
Very often I started something in life and gave up, 
now I decided that I would set the task of becoming a programmer, 
and I just do it, no matter what
At first it was difficult for me, 
but now I can do it easily. 
The only thing is that there is not always time, 
since I work on a rotational basis. 
I confidently know layout and javascript, 
I want to quickly learn react and start looking for work and orders.
